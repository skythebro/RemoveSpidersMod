# RemoveSpidersMod

I've tested my mod a lot and have not noticed any new webs appearing or spiders appearing from under rocks.

If you happen onto a bug where you do see webs or spiders be sure to open an Issue!
So I can check it out!

And Thank you for downloading my mod!

## Requirements: [MelonLoader v0.6.0 ALPHA Pre-Release](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/releases/download/v0.6.0/MelonLoader.x64.zip) and [my mod](https://github.com/skythebro/RemoveSpidersMod/releases)

## Installation:

1. Open the MelonLoader.x64.zip and extract the contents into the Sons Of The Forest Game folder for me this is: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Sons Of The Forest. 
2. After you have done that you need to start up your game once for Melonloader to get everything set up.
3. Now check your game folder there should be a Mods folder in it now.
4. Drag and drop the RemoveSpidersMod.dll that you downloaded from my release into the Mods folder.
5. Done! 

### Extra: 
The MelonLoader console window has extra logging info on what my mod is doing, it is not important to you ofcourse but it is a nice thing to have.
Every time you load into a game you'll have a few lag spikes the first few seconds.
This is because my mod is removing all of the webs and making sure that all rocks even new ones will not have any spiders spawning when you pick them up.

#### P.S.:
This is my first ever mod so I hope it does it's job well! 
If you're a mod maker and know of a better way of doing what my mod does. Release your mod and I'll make sure to put a link on my repo to yours. â™¥
